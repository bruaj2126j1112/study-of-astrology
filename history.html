<p><h2>History of Astrology</h2>
<br><h3>
Astrology is a method of predicting mundane events based upon the assumption that the celestial
bodies-particularly the planets and the stars considered in their arbitrary combinations 
or configurations (called constellations)-in some way either determine or indicate 
changes in the sublunar world.</h3></p>
<br>
<h2>Scientific Analysis and Criticism</h2>
<br>
<h3>Astrology consists of a number of belief systems that hold that there is a relationship
 between astronomical phenomena and events or descriptions of personality in the human world.
 Astrology has been rejected by the scientific community as having no explanatory power for
 describing the universe.</p></h3>
<br>
<h2>Cultura Impact</h2>
<br>
<h3>Astrological belief in correspondences between celestial observations and terrestrial 
events have influenced various aspects of human history, including world-views, language 
and many elements of social culture.
</h3>
<br>
<h2>Theological viewpoints</h2>
<br><h3>
In the seventh century, Isidore of Seville argued in his Etymologiae that astronomy 
described the movements of the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific,
 describing the movements of the sun, the moon and the stars, while the other, making 
predictions, was theologically erroneous.
